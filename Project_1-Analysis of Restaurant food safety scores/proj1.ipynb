It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
